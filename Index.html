    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Timaeus was a legendary white dragon known as the Ice Wyrm, a title earned for the intricate and mesmerizing ice formations it created in its wake. Legends spoke of its origins in the heart of the coldest mountain range, where the purest snow and the harshest blizzards reigned.

        Unlike most white dragons that were depicted as massive and intimidating, Timaeus was smaller in size but remarkably agile and graceful. Its scales were pearlescent white, shimmering with an opalescent glow. Aelfrost's eyes sparkled like sapphires, and delicate patterns of frost adorned its wings and tail, glistening in the light.</p>

    <!-- History -->
    <h3>My History</h3>
    <p>For centuries, Timaeus lived in isolation, seldom interacting with other creatures. Its solitude was a testament to the dragon's bond with the icy wilderness and the mysteries of the elements. Few knew of the existence of the Ice Wyrm, and most believed it to be a mere legend spun from the icy winds.
        Over the ages, brave adventurers, lost wanderers, and seekers of wisdom stumbled upon the dragon's territory. Timaeus, though reclusive, occasionally imparted its wisdom, teaching the travelers about the harsh but beautiful nature of winter, the balance of life, and the importance of respecting the natural world
        At a point in history, an upheaval occurred, disrupting the balance of nature. The Great Frost Wars erupted, threatening to upset the delicate equilibrium Timaeus had guarded for eons. The dragon, drawn into the conflict, displayed its immense power, freezing armies and battling forces that sought to exploit the primal forces of winter.
        The wars brought devastation to the land, leaving scars upon the icy landscapes Timaeus had cherished. The dragon, bearing witness to the turmoil caused by the conflict, chose to withdraw from the world, vanishing into the mists of time. Its departure was mourned by those who had revered its wisdom and sought its guidance.
        Though absent, the Ice Wyrm's legacy persisted in tales passed down through generations. The lessons of Timaeus, its teachings of harmony with nature, and the beauty of the wintry landscapes continued to inspire storytellers, artists, and those who sought to understand the mysteries of the frozen world.
        The history of Timaeus, like many legendary dragons, became a part of the lore and mythos, a testament to the profound connection between the white dragon and the essence of winter itself.
